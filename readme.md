A full video demonstration is available [demo](demo/Topic4_GroupB_LineFollowRobot_demo_video_1.mp4).

## Project Description

The project is a simple line following robot with obstacle sensing capabilities. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface and avoid obstacles in its path. The robot is equipped with three IR sensors for line following and two IR sensors for obstacle detection. The robot is programmed to follow the line using the line following sensors and avoid obstacles using the obstacle detection sensors. The robot is controlled by an ESP32 board and powered by a battery. The robot is designed to be simple, low-cost, and easy to build, making it suitable for educational purposes and hobby projects.
